# NHANES Capstone Project

This project analyzes adult anthropometric data from the NHANES 2020 survey. Using Python, the study explores body measurements, computes derived health indicators, and visualizes key patterns to compare male and female participants.  

The analysis covers:  
- Descriptive statistics of weight, height, waist, and hip measurements  
- Calculation and standardization of Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Correlation analysis across anthropometric variables  
- Visualization of distributions and relationships through histograms, boxplots, and scatter matrices  
- Comparison of BMI, waist‑to‑height ratio (WHtR), and waist‑to‑hip ratio (WHR) as health indicators  

**Key Insight:** While BMI remains a widely used measure, WHtR and WHR provide additional perspectives on health risk, highlighting differences between male and female participants.
